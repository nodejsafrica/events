# Node NG Conf Code of Conduct

## PURPOSE
All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the code of conduct.

Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.

Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## ANTI-HARASSMENT
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Invasion of personal space
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## ENFORCEMENT
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

Event organisers may take action to address anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

## REPORTING
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

## INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE
In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we strongly believe it’s important to pay attention to harmful language patterns.

### Albeism
Words like “crazy”, “dumb”, “insane” or “lame” are examples of ableist language, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read [this guide](http://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html).

### Sexism
Using gendered terms like “dude” or “guys” to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.
