# Node NG Conf 2018 Speaker Guide

We would love to see anything that falls within any of the following categories:
- Interesting Node.js hacks, tips and tricks
- Application of Node.js in other domains asides Backend Web Development. This includes, but is not limited to A.I, IoT, Front End Development, CLI Development, Browser Extension Development, and any other one you think would be interesting
- Current trends within the Node.js ecosystem
- Awesome tools you would like us to know about
- Building the Node.js ecosystem
- How you/your company has used Node.js to drive business goals
- Anything else you can think of.

## Guidelines
- Language: all talks are in English.
- Talk Duration: talks should be 20 minutes long (for longer talks we‚Äôll get in touch with you directly). We will be on a tight schedule and will enforce the time limits rigorously. We suggest that you time your presentation accordingly in advance.
- Formatting: make sure you care, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious and will reflect negatively on the outcome of your submission.
- Brevity: don‚Äôt get too wordy. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your proposal, we ask you to put more time into focussing your application. With the amount of submissions we get, the quicker you can make a good first impression, the better.
- Originality: one of the things we want to do at Node NG Conf is to push the community forward. We can‚Äôt do this if the same people talk about the same things all the time. Thus, we favor original content. If you want to present a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, new research or development to it ‚Äî something to make it unique.

If you need some tips and encouragement on making your proposal stand out, you should read [this guide](http://blog.cssconf.eu/2014/06/12/how-to-write-a-great-talk-proposal-for-a-tech/)
